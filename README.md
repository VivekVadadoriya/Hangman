## What is a Hangman Game

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter that occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.
